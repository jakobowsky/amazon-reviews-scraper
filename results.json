    "message": "Red Bull is red bull, speaks for itself as a great energy drink. Not loaded with caffeine but balances compared to others so you can drink and enjoy more with getting so much caffeine. And the taste is just too good. Sometimes the sugar can definitely be a problem, but they have other option for when you\u2019re not needing the sugar."

    "message": "If you dont want to hear the backstory just scroll down to the end but if you want to know why you NEED to buy this pack of red bull....I work at night and often find myself longing for a pillow and blanket around 3 AM. I typically then zombie walk to the vending machines and purchase whatever energy drink is in stock. And you know vending machines.. I'm paying around $3.50 for a dose of wake me up...Well.. Rewind to last week and my zombie walk to the vending machines. I'm standing at one of four machines available to me and I see the red bull energy drink looking at me. I swipe my card and type in 58 (my go to energy drink slot) and the machine just beeps. I'm like.. really tired so I just swipe my card again, hit 58 and again here a beep. Machine says Offline by Vendor. Now I'm used to occassionaly the machine being out of stock, but I can see what I want.I move onto the Pepsi machine and try to get a dew..... Machine offline by vendor. I mutter some words not too safe to type here, call some of my coworkers to inquire how long the machine hasn't been working and no one knows.So I'm stranded with a few hours of work left and an hour drive home. Exhausted. I tell myself, something MUST change. Where do I look for answers?! Why amazon of course, and red bull.Some Facts:- It takes approximately ten minutes for the caffeine in a red bull to go into your bloodstream.- The peak levels of caffeine will take place 20-50 minutes after drinking assuming you just chug the drink. During this time you should feel alert and ready to do whatever you need- After about an hour your body will experience a \"crash\" which occurs when the sugar levels in your bloodstream drop and the effects of caffeine that you have felt in the past hour start to wear off.Now that was just about energy drinks in general, now lets move to why red bull vs some of the others.-Red bull contains: Taurine which is an amino acid, B-Group Vitamins to help maintain normal body functions, Caffeine (of course) and as much sugar as an equivalent amount of either apple or orange juice. So its really not THAT bad for you.-Red bull cans are 100% recyclable.-More than 75 Billion cans have been sold over 31 years in 171 countries. They are obviously doing something good.In my opinion the red bulls taste good and they work for me. I can crack one open when I get tired and it may take me an hour or two to finish it as I'm a slow sipper but it gets the job done. It keeps me awake, doesn't make me feel full like some other drinks that I have had and the price (on amazon at least) is perfect for me. I ordered a case of 24 and make sure that I always have some at home, at work and in my car in case I need a quick pick me up!"
